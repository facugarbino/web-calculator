# web-calculator
This is a basic web-based calculator that I made during an online course I took at frontendmasters.com
Javascript code is unoptimized since I wrote it very quickly and not being careful or writing many functions.
It works though. I followed the course interface even though I should've add a point key so you can enter
decimal numbers. I'm too lazy now to add it but will do. Also, will add the equal feature so when you click
on it after making a calculation, it uses the same operator and 2nd operating than the last one as many calculators do.
